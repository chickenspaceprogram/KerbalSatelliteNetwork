# KerbalSatelliteNetwork
 Helps you put satellites in the proper final and transfer orbits for a satellite network around a body in Kerbal Space Program.
 Currently provides the periods, periapses, apoapses, and semi-major axes of the initial and transfer orbits. Delta-V totals will come in future.
 Documentation of how to use this properly will come soon, but essentially, start in the transfer orbit, wait until you reach periapsis, detach a satellite, and burn that satellite's engines so that it is in the final orbit. Repeat this until you've detached your desired number of satellites. 
 For a proper satellite network, ensure that the periods of each final orbit are precisely equal (using Kerbal Engineer or similar). The apoapses and periapses matter less than the periods do, the goal is to have orbits with the same period so that the network doesn't drift. Getting precisely equal periods is nigh-impossible, since floating point does its thing, but you should be able to get within 0.001s with Kerbal Engineer.
